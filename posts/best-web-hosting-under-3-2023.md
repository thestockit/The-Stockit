## Why Cheap Hosting?

You might wonder: _Why do some companies offer web hosting so cheaply while others are expensive?_

The truth is that large hosting companies like **GoDaddy** spend millions on advertising (e.g., $6M on a Super Bowl ad). Smaller hosting providers avoid these extra expenses and take smaller profit margins, allowing them to pass the savings on to you.

That means you can get **affordable hosting with excellent uptime, security, and features**‚Äîwithout overspending.
