## What is MonetizeMore?

MonetizeMore is a Canada-based ad exchange platform founded in 2010. It was one of the first outsourced SSPs to focus on ad optimization rather than just management.

A key milestone came in 2014, when MonetizeMore partnered with Google, gaining access to AdX, AdSense, and DEP. This partnership significantly boosted ad performance for publishers.

---

## Best Features

MonetizeMore offers several features that set it apart. It is a Google Certified Partner and provides AI-powered header bidding along with full programmatic advertising solutions. Publishers also benefit from direct access to Google AdX, fast-loading ads, and the advantage of no DNS takeover. Another strong point is the absence of contract lock-ins, giving publishers more flexibility.

## Achievements

Over the years, MonetizeMore has achieved recognition as one of the fastest-growing Canadian companies. It has won the Google Innovation Award in both 2021 and 2022, as well as the Google CSAT Change Agent Award in 2021.

Today, the company manages over 1000 websites and serves more than 15 billion monthly ad impressions.

---

## Ad Formats

MonetizeMore supports a wide variety of ad formats to help publishers optimize revenue. These include text ads, banner and display ads in both horizontal and vertical layouts, rich media formats such as HTML, video, and dynamic images, as well as responsive ads and recommended or native ads.

With the help of AI-driven optimization, these formats deliver higher RPMs compared to traditional ad networks.

---

## Publisher Requirements

To join MonetizeMore, publishers are required to have a minimum of 500,000 monthly pageviews. They must also comply 100% with Google AdX policies.

The good news is that there are no language restrictions, which makes the platform more accessible globally.

---

## Payment Methods

MonetizeMore provides flexible payment options. Publishers can get paid via PayPal, Wire Transfer, or ACH. The minimum payout threshold is $100, and the company follows a Net 30 payment schedule.

---

## Pros and Cons

MonetizeMore has many advantages for publishers. It offers some of the highest RPMs in the industry, a pay-for-performance model, transparent reporting, and round-the-clock expert support. Publishers also appreciate the absence of contract lock-ins and the free setup of DFP and header bidding.

On the downside, its reporting is not yet fully automated, and the traffic requirement of 500,000 monthly pageviews is quite high, which may limit accessibility for smaller publishers.
