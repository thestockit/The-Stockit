# Ad Exchange vs Ad Network: Key Differences Every Publisher Must Know

At first glance, an **ad exchange** and an **ad network** may seem like the same thing. Both are programmatic advertising platforms, but in reality, they serve **different purposes**.

In fact, many publishers confuse **Ad Exchanges (or SSPs â€“ Supply Side Platforms)** with **Ad Networks (or DSPs â€“ Demand Side Platforms)**. The truth is, these two technologies are designed to **work together**, not compete.

This article breaks down what each is, how they operate, and the **key differences publishers need to know**.

## What Is an Ad Exchange?

An **Ad Exchange** is a **technology-driven marketplace** where publishers sell their ad space and advertisers bid in real-time to buy it.

- Publishers list their available ad inventory.
- Advertisers (via ad networks or DSPs) place bids.
- Ads are sold to the **highest bidder per impression**.

ðŸ‘‰ Simply put: An ad exchange connects publishers and advertisers directly through **real-time bidding (RTB)**.

**Examples of Popular Ad Exchanges:**

- **Ezoic**
- **MonetizeMore**

## What Is an Ad Network?

An **Ad Network** aggregates ad inventory from multiple publishers and resells it to advertisers, usually at a markup. Unlike ad exchanges, they donâ€™t rely solely on bidding; instead, they package inventory into segments (audience demographics, location, niche).

ðŸ‘‰ Think of an ad network as a **broker** between publishers and advertisers.

**Examples of Popular Ad Networks:**

- **Google AdSense**
- **Media.net**
- **Mediavine**

## Which Is Better for Publishers?

- If youâ€™re a **small publisher** just starting, an **Ad Network** like Google AdSense is often easier to join.
- If you have **established traffic** and want **greater revenue control**, an **Ad Exchange** may provide higher earnings.

ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip:** Many publishers combine both â€” using ad networks for stability and ad exchanges for higher CPM opportunities.

## Final Thoughts

Both **ad exchanges** and **ad networks** are critical parts of the programmatic ecosystem. Instead of seeing them as competitors, understand how they **complement each other**:
