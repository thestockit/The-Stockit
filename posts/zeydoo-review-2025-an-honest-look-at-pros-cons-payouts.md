**Quick Verdict:** Zeydoo is a legitimate and powerful CPA network, scoring a **9/10** in our 2025 review. It excels with its vast offer selection and user-friendly platform, backed by the PropellerAds ecosystem. The main drawbacks are its high $100 minimum payout and standard NET30 terms. It's best for affiliates with consistent traffic in CPA, CPL, and sweepstakes verticals.

## 1. What is Zeydoo? The PropellerAds Connection:

Launched in 2019, ZEYDOO is a Cyprus-based CPA affiliate network that has rapidly gained traction for a key reason: it gets **private CPA offers directly from PropellerAds advertisers**.

Founded back in 2011, PropellerAds is a global ad giant serving over 12 billion ad impressions daily. This connection is Zeydoo's secret weapon. It means affiliates get unique access to a pool of offers vetted by one of the world's largest traffic sources, often resulting in less competition and better payouts.

**In simple terms:** Zeydoo is the affiliate-facing arm of the PropellerAds ecosystem.

## 2. How Does a CPA Network Work?

CPA stands for **Cost Per Action**. Affiliates (publishers) are paid a commission each time they drive a user who completes a specific action like a sign-up, download, or purchase. The network (Zeydoo) acts as the middleman, connecting advertisers with affiliates, handling tracking, payments, and support.

## 3. Zeydoo Review 2025: The Pros and Cons:

After thorough testing and analyzing feedback from affiliate communities, here's our balanced breakdown.

### 3.1 üëç The Pros:

- **PropellerAds Powerhouse:** Direct access to offers from PropellerAds' massive advertiser base is a unique advantage. This translates to exclusive offers and often more competitive payouts.
- **User-Friendly Platform:** Their self-built affiliate dashboard is genuinely intuitive. Filtering 600+ offers by GEO, vertical, and device is seamless and lag-free, saving you crucial time.
- **Robust Anti-Fraud & Transparency:** A powerful in-house fraud prevention system ensures you get paid for legitimate conversions. Real-time statistics are reliable and update without significant delays.
- **Top-Tier Support:** The 24/7 support via **Telegram live chat** is a game-changer. Getting help in minutes, rather than days via email, is a huge advantage for active marketers.

### 3.2 üëé The Cons:

- **High Minimum Payout:** A **$100 minimum** for Payoneer/WebMoney is steep compared to networks like MaxBounty or CPAGrip, which offer $25-$50 thresholds. This can be a barrier for new affiliates.
- **NET-30 Payment Terms:** You must wait up to 30 days after the end of the month you earned the money. This is standard but can be a cash-flow challenge compared to networks with bi-weekly or weekly payments.
- **Less Beginner-Focused:** While the platform is easy to use, the network itself is geared towards affiliates who already have a traffic source. It lacks extensive "how-to" guides for complete beginners.
