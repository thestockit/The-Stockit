## üìñ What is a Tier 2 Affiliate Program?

When you refer someone to an affiliate program:

1. They sign up and start promoting products.
2. They make commissions on their sales.
3. You earn a **small commission on their earnings**‚Äîfor as long as they remain active.

üëâ This creates a **double commission stream**: one from your own sales and one from the affiliates you refer.
