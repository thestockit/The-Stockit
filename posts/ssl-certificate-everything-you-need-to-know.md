## 🔒 What Is an SSL Certificate?

An **SSL certificate** is a digital security credential that:

- Creates a unique **encrypted connection**
- Provides a secure browsing experience

This ensures all sensitive data like passwords, credit card numbers, and personal details remain safe between the **server and browser**.

To secure its site, Stockpile needs an SSL certificate. The **Certificate Authority (CA)** validates their business identity by:
