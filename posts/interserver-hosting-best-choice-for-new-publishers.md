## Why Choose InterServer?

Unlike big names like GoDaddy or Hostinger that spend millions on marketing, **InterServer focuses on performance and customer value**.  

Recent updates have significantly boosted their platform speed, making them a serious contender for budget-friendly yet **high-performance hosting**.

---

## Renewal Price & Price Lock

Most hosting providers lure you in with promotional prices that **double or triple** upon renewal.  

ðŸ‘‰ With **InterServerâ€™s Price Lock Guarantee**, you pay the same subscription fee for life as long as your account remains active.  

Example:  
- InterServerâ€™s Standard Plan started at **$5/mo**. Even though it later increased to $7/mo, early adopters still pay $5.  
- Competitors like Hostinger or ScalaHosting might look cheaper at first, but renewal costs skyrocket.

This **transparency** sets InterServer apart.

---

## InterServer Hosting Plans

InterServer offers three simple plans:

- **Standard Plan** â†’ $7/mo (was $5)  
- **Boost 2 Plan** â†’ $10/mo  
- **Boost 4 Plan** â†’ $20/mo  

ðŸ’¡ All plans share the same core features â€” the difference lies in resources allocated. For small and medium sites, the **Standard Plan is more than enough**.

---

## Performance

Performance is InterServerâ€™s biggest strength.  

âš¡ My $5 Standard Plan loaded a media-heavy website in **1.3 seconds** â€” faster than Namecheap and Hostinger, which took **3x longer** under similar conditions.  

Since InterServer uses the **same infrastructure across all plans**, even entry-level users enjoy **premium-grade performance**.

---

## Security Tools

InterServer includes its proprietary **InterShield Security** at no extra cost.  

### ðŸ”’ Features include:
- Firewall protection  
- Automatic virus scanning  
- Malicious file detection  
- Web attack defense  
- Server-side caching with Cloudflare integration  

This ensures both **speed and security** for your website.

---

## Student Hosting Deals

Are you a student? ðŸŽ“ InterServer offers **1 year of free hosting** if you sign up with a `.edu` email address.  

Even without one, you can contact support to request a student plan. This makes InterServer an excellent choice for **projects, portfolios, or school websites**.

---

## ASP.net Hosting

A unique feature most reviews miss: **InterServer offers ASP.net (Windows) hosting**.  

Perfect if you require:
- Microsoft SQL Servers  
- Microsoft Access  
- Windows-specific applications  

This makes InterServer one of the few affordable providers for **Windows-based developers**.

---

## Refunds & Compensation

InterServer guarantees **99.9% uptime**. If they fail, youâ€™re entitled to **compensation in hosting credits** based on downtime severity.  

âœ… Just track outages, submit a support ticket, and theyâ€™ll credit your account.

- âœ… **No hidden renewal traps** (Price Lock Guarantee)  
- âœ… **Fast, reliable performance** even on cheap plans  
- âœ… **Robust security tools included free**
