# Top Ad Networks for New Publishers to Monetize Their Websites

Every publisher dreams of turning their hard work into a steady source of income, but getting started can be challenging. As a new publisher, one of the biggest hurdles is meeting the strict requirements of top-level ad networks like Google AdSense. With limited content and traffic, approval often feels out of reach. The good news is that there are several Adsense alternatives designed specifically for beginners, with minimal requirements and reliable payouts. These networks give you a chance to monetize your website while you continue building traffic and authority.

In this article, we will highlight the best ad networks for new publishers that are easy to join, user-friendly, and proven to reward publishers fairly.

## RevenueHits

RevenueHits tops the list as one of the most beginner-friendly ad networks available today. It is a self-service platform that allows publishers to fully monetize their websites through advanced ad-serving technology. The platform processes more than 2 billion impressions daily and has over 20,000 publishers worldwide.

One of the unique advantages of RevenueHits is that it offers equal payout rates across all regions. Whether your traffic comes from Tier 1 countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, or Tier 3 countries like India and Pakistan, you can expect the same rates. The platform also supports multiple ad formats, including pop ads, push notifications, in-page push, interstitials, and content blockers. The minimum payout is only $5, and payments can be received through PayPal, Payoneer, Bitcoin, wire transfer, and other global payment options.

## Ezoic

Ezoic is a Google-certified ad exchange network and one of the fastest-growing platforms in the industry. It is widely considered the best AdSense alternative in terms of revenue potential. What sets Ezoic apart is its artificial intelligenceâ€“driven ad tester that optimizes ad placements automatically based on user behavior and preferences. This ensures higher engagement and better revenue for publishers.

The platform serves over 1.7 billion ad impressions monthly and offers additional learning resources to help new publishers. Ezoic accepts websites without a strict traffic requirement, making it easy for beginners to join. The minimum payout is $20, and payments can be withdrawn via PayPal, Payoneer, Wise, bank transfer, or check. Since Ezoic is a Google Partner, new publishers must comply with Google Publisher Policies.

## AdMaven

AdMaven is a premium ad network that supports CPM, CPC, and CPA payment models. With more than 1 billion ad impressions per month, it provides an excellent opportunity for publishers who were rejected by AdSense or want to diversify their income. The platform is extremely user-friendly, supports all verticals, and does not require a minimum traffic threshold to get started.

Publishers can monetize their websites through multiple ad formats, including pop ads, push notifications, in-page push, interstitials, and content blockers. AdMavenâ€™s minimum payout is $5, and it supports a wide range of payment methods, including PayPal, Payoneer, Bitcoin, and wire transfer. The only limitation is that under-construction websites are not accepted.

## PropellerAds

PropellerAds is one of the most popular ad networks, with a reputation for delivering massive global traffic. Founded in 2011, the network now serves more than 12 million ad impressions daily and reaches over one billion users monthly. This makes it one of the biggest alternative traffic sources for advertisers worldwide.

PropellerAds works on a CPM model, meaning publishers are paid for every 1,000 impressions they generate. The network supports multiple ad formats, including push notifications, in-page push, popunders, interstitials, and direct click ads. With a low minimum payout of $5 and flexible payment methods such as PayPal, Skrill, Webmoney, and wire transfer, PropellerAds remains one of the most reliable choices for new publishers.

Yllix is another excellent choice for new publishers, especially because of its instant approval system and extremely low payout threshold. This global CPM, CPC, and CPA advertising network accepts minimal traffic and still pays consistently. Publishers can withdraw earnings starting from just $1, with payment cycles available daily, weekly, or monthly.

The platform supports a variety of ad formats such as banners, redirects, sliders, popups, popunders, and direct links. Yllix works for both adult and non-adult websites, although revenue depends largely on traffic quality and audience location. Additionally, Yllix offers a referral program where affiliates can earn up to $100 for every new active user they bring in.
