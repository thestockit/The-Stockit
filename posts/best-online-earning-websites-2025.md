If you prefer a gig-based system, **Fiverr** is one of the best-known marketplaces.

For those who want a project-based freelancing model, **PeoplePerHour** is a UK-based site that connects businesses with skilled professionals in areas like digital marketing, branding, content writing, and web development. It is free to join and open to freelancers worldwide. On the other hand, **JustAnswer** is a unique Q&A platform that lets certified experts monetize their knowledge in fields such as law, veterinary services, mechanics, and home improvement. While the chat option is free, users pay extra for in-depth phone consultations, giving experts an excellent way to earn from their expertise.

When it comes to internet marketing, **Muncheye** serves as a launch hub for new apps, software, and tools. It connects developers with affiliates, making it an ideal choice for those interested in promoting products and earning commissions through affiliate marketing. Creative individuals may prefer **MiPic**, a platform that transforms original artwork and photography into print-on-demand products such as framed prints, T-shirts, phone cases, and wallpapers.

For professionals in the blockchain industry, **CryptoJobList** is a specialized job board dedicated to cryptocurrency and blockchain-related work. It offers roles in development, marketing, mining, and HR, with many jobs paying in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital currencies. Finally, **Trymata**, formerly known as TryMyUI, is a usability testing platform where users are paid to test websites and apps.
