If you are new to affiliate marketing and want to earn quick money, the **MyLead affiliate network** is a great starting point. It is a comprehensive platform offering multiple partner programs, and the best part is that you donâ€™t need prior investment or advanced skills to begin earning online. This makes it an excellent option for both beginners and professionals who want to expand their revenue streams.

MyLead Global is a Poland-based online CPA and PPC platform founded in 2014. Since its launch, it has grown rapidly and was recognized in 2020 with the prestigious **DELOITTE Technology Fast 50 award**, ranking among the fastest-growing platforms in Central Europe. The platform has attracted more than **400,000 publishers from 154 countries**, achieved a remarkable **1222% growth in a single year**, and has already paid out over **$8 million** to affiliates. These numbers prove that MyLead is a legitimate and trusted choice for affiliate marketers worldwide.

The business model of MyLead is designed to provide flexibility and variety. The platform offers access to over **4,300 partner programs** across multiple categories, giving affiliates the chance to earn through nine different models. These include Cost per Lead (CPL), Cost per Sale (CPS), Cost per Action (CPA), Pay per Install (PPI), and Cost on Delivery (COD). In addition, there are options like SMS campaigns, surveys, and more. To make it even easier for publishers, MyLead provides banners, deep links, smartlinks, product feeds, landing pages, and coupons to promote offers effectively.

One of the standout advantages of MyLead is that the network is **open to everyone**. Beginners benefit from mentorship and step-by-step guidance, while professionals gain access to advanced tools and reporting features. This inclusive approach makes it both beginner-friendly and powerful enough for experienced affiliates. Another plus point is the freedom to promote MyLead offers on popular platforms like **Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Twitter**. Unlike strict affiliate programs such as Amazon Associates, MyLead gives publishers flexibility, although it prohibits shady or misleading marketing tactics. Violating the platformâ€™s policies can result in removal, ensuring that its community remains ethical and trustworthy.

When it comes to payments, MyLead is quite flexible. The **minimum payout is just $20**, and affiliates can withdraw their earnings through multiple methods including PayPal, Skrill, Bitcoin, Revolut, Capitalist, Iomeney, and Qiwi. This variety makes it accessible for affiliates worldwide, especially those who want faster and more convenient payment options.

Additionally, MyLead offers a **referral program**, where affiliates can earn **5% of the revenue** generated by anyone who joins using their referral link. This creates an extra passive income stream on top of the commissions earned directly from affiliate programs, making the platform even more attractive.

In conclusion, **MyLead is definitely worth considering in 2023**, particularly if you are just starting your affiliate journey. While it may not be as large as some of the global networks like FlexOffers or JVZoo, it offers beginner support, diverse earning models, flexible payment options, and a referral program that adds long-term value. If you are looking to diversify your affiliate income streams, MyLead can be a solid addition to your strategy.
